# 🔁 Day 71 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔍 Problem: Detect Loop in Linked List
### 📌 Level: Easy
### 🏁 Status: ✅ Problem Solved Successfully

## 📘 Problem Summary:
Given a singly linked list, determine whether it contains a cycle (loop) or not.

## 💭 Real-World Relevance:
- In real-world systems, unintentional loops in data structures (like linked lists) can lead to:

- Infinite loops in algorithms

- Memory leaks

- Unexpected behavior in caching, task scheduling, etc.

- Detecting these cycles is vital to ensuring reliable and efficient systems.

## 🚀 Solution Strategy: Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm
- Also known as the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm:

- Two pointers (slow and fast) traverse the list at different speeds.

- If a loop exists, they are bound to meet at some point.

- If they never meet, the list is loop-free.

## 🧠 Performance Snapshot:
